# 🏛️ DPIIT Budget Allocation Analysis (FY2021–25)

This repository presents an end-to-end data analytics project focused on analyzing the **Union Budget allocation** for India’s **Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)**. It explores how key industrial schemes have evolved over recent years and provides insights using Python, Power BI, and Excel.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Track year-wise budget allocation trends for key schemes (e.g., Startup India, NICDIT)
- Analyze Establishment Expenditure vs. Central Sector Schemes
- Identify top-funded initiatives in FY2024–25 and trends for FY2025–26
- Visualize the findings using Power BI

## 🧠 Key Questions Addressed

1. How have allocations changed over time?
2. What is the growth rate of DPIIT's budget vs. GDP growth?
3. Which schemes received the highest funding recently?
4. What is the ratio of Establishment Expenditure?
5. How have MSME/IPR-focused budgets evolved?

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Python** (`pandas`, `tabula-py`): Data extraction and cleaning
- **Power BI**: Dashboard and report building
- **Excel**: Validation and quick summaries
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and documentation
